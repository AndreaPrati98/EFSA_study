# EFSA_study
In a hypothetical toxicological in-vivo experiment (toxicity study) a substance X was administered to
laboratory animals and three endpoints (endpoint 1, 2 and 3) were measured to define the reference
point in order to set up health based guidance values (HBGV) for substance X. Eight groups of animals
were tested, 4 groups of males and 4 groups of females. For each gender, one group was used as a
control and each remaining group received one of three doses of substance X (30 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg
and 150 mg/kg, administered to each animal daily). The endpoint values were measured for each
animal 90 days after the beginning of the experiment. Information on the animals used in the
experiment as well as summary information (mean and standard deviation, SD for each group of
animals) on the endpoints measured at the end of the experiment is provided in table 2. It is
requested to propose an appropriate statistical model and to analyse these data.
